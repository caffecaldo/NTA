- reporting:
  - current/upcoming test eligibilities
  - from <start date> to <end date> (in the past), who did what tests

- TESTS table:
  - rank_order - so we know what the student tested / is testing for
  - references the 'order' column in Ranks

- Attendance:
  - print student list, grouped by rank / ordered by name (first? last?)
  - edit sheet
    - click auto-selects field (might be handy everywhere)
    - change checkboxes to numeric fields
    - add class_hours column
      - the idea is that a '1' could be put in for any given day, or the total # of hours could be entered in the last day of the month (total # of 'X's from paper attendance sheet)
      - exception would be when a student tests:
        - classes from start of month up to but not including test day - entered into box for the day just prior to test day
        - classes from test day to end of month - entered into last day of the month

- Notes
  - need to be able to specify student when adding/changing

- Students
	- types
		- new student, no rank (Member)
		- new student, existing rank from another dojo
		- existing student, no rank (Member)
		- existing student, existing rank
	- new/edit - initial rank saved to Students
	- show - initial rank & created_at date (not datetime)
		- iterate through Tests.all for this student, display all Test days & rank tested in chronological order - if no tests, leave blank
	- "carry forward" from old system -> edit Attendance sheet, put total # of classes at some date prior to official cutover to new system, eg, last day of last month
